## Assignment 4 - ADFGX Implementation
### ADFGX Cipher
The ADFGX cipher was a field cipher used by the German Army during World War I. It is closely related to the ADFGVX cipher. ADFGX is a fractionating transposition cipher which combined a modified Polybius square with a single columnar transposition. The cipher is named after the five possible letters used in the ciphertext: A, D, F, G and X. These letters were chosen deliberately because they sound very different from each other when transmitted via morse code. The intention was to reduce the possibility of operator error.
